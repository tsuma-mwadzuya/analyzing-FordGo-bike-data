# Ford GoBike System Dataset

## by Samuel Tsuma


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system
covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It consists of 16 columns and a total of 
183412 rows (inclusive of rows with missing values). Majority of the variables (9) are 
numeric (float and imteger) in nature, while the remaining (5) variables are categorical
in nature. The dataset can be found [here](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data)


The analysis done on this dataset was limited to bike users ***born between 1941 
(currently aged 80) and the present year (2022)** and not based on the entire dataset.


## Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis, Subscribers form the majority of users, accounting for 89% 
of all bike users. Customers make up for the remaining 11% of bike users. It is also 
evident that biking is male dominated since we have the largest number of users 
being Male in both Customer(accounting for 69%) and Subscriber (accounting for 75%) 
categories. Females form the second largest number of user in both user categories
(28% for customers and 23% for subscribers) while those identifying as Other make
the least number of users(3% for customers and 2% for subscribers).

Most riders are either youth or middle-aged (ages of 25-45 years) in both user 
categories. Generally, Subscribers record slightly higher average ages than 
Customers across the three gender categories. Riders identifyng as other have
the highest average age followed by male and lastly women. It's important to 
note that the average ages across the two user types are for middle-aged people.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The presentation focuses on three major demographics i.e User-Type, Gender
and Age, and how they relate. I start by looking at the distribution percentages of
bike users by User-Type (customer or subscriber), followed by distribution percentages 
of Gender categories of all users and lastly the Age distribution among bike users.
I use pie charts for User-Type and Gender variables and plot a histogram to show 
Age distribution among bike users.

Lastly I will look at the average riders' Age for each Gender category across the User-Type.
For this, I use a point plot for clarity and accuracy of the means.
